## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. Traditional rule-based systems for fraud detection may not be sufficient to handle sophisticated fraudulent activities. Machine learning models can help identify fraudulent transactions by learning from historical data patterns.

This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset obtained from Kaggle, enabling the creation of a fraud detection model that can be used to identify suspicious transactions in real-time.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains a large number of credit card transactions, some of which are fraudulent, along with various features that describe each transaction. The dataset is labeled, meaning each transaction is marked as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

**Dataset Features:**
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- ...
- Feature N
- Class (0: Non-fraudulent, 1: Fraudulent)

## Result

Machine Learning model that uses Random Forest Classifier to classify credit card transaction as fraud or valid. The Model has an accuracy of **98%** !
